// Problem of Apollonius circles: given 3 circles, find the circles
// which are simultaneously tangent to the 3 circles. There are two such
// circles, thus the core constraints should have two solutions.

// The initial circles are determined by their centers (c1x, c1y),
// (c2x, c2y), (c3x, c3y), and their radius r1, r2, r3.

// The variables of the problem are the center and radius of the circle we search for: cx, cy, r.

// To obtain nice drawings with AbSolute -v option, uncomment the x,y
// variables and the constraints accordingly: (i) to draw the initial
// circle, (ii) to draw the unknown circle and (iii) for all of them.
